Daily Rituals: How Great Minds Make Time, Find Inspiration, and Get to Work by Mason Currey (Read 7 July 2020.)

A fairly straightforward concept for this book, which originated as a blog. The author simply collates the work habits of a lot of different writers, artists etc.

What's interesting is that there isn't much of a common theme. Some writers & artists abuse drugs and alcohol. Others don't. Some set a strict timetable for work, others don't. Some love their work, others seem to regard it as torture. Some like to work in the morning, others late at night.

I did notice that many of the people featured like to include a daily walk, and taking a daily nap seemed more common than in the population at large. There also seemed to be a common habit of taking solo time away from normal life.
