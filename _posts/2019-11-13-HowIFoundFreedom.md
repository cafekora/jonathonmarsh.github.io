**Summary**

Self-published libertarian text from the early 1970s, quite an interesting take on life, although some things have dated badly, and I certainly wouldn't follow his financial advice.

**My notes**

Lots of stuff about the pointlessness of being unselfish. Also his disagreements with the concepts of government, law etc. but also about not confronting or organizing.
