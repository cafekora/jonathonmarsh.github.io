**Summary**

I love Murakami's novels, and I love running, so I was interested to read this, a fairly slender piece of non-fiction. Basically him musing on running and how it relates to the rest of his life

**My notes**

He observes that he does a lot of his thinking by writing.

When writing a novel, he stops at the point where he can write more, so there's a smooth start the next day. 

The most important thing we ever learn at school is the fact that the most important things can’t be learned at school.

Muscles are hard to get and easy to lose. Fat is easy to get and hard to lose.

There are three reasons I failed. Not enough training. Not enough training. And not enough training. That’s it in a word. 

Most of what I know about writing I’ve learned through running every day. These are practical, physical lessons.

No matter how slow I might run, I wasn’t about to walk. That was the rule. Break one of my rules once, and I’m bound to break many more.

Mantra to self when running: I’m not a human. I’m a piece of machinery. I don’t need to feel a thing. Just forge on ahead.
