**Summary**

Overview of a lot of Kahneman's work, lot's of on cognitive biases etc.

**My notes**

* “System 1” = The instant, unconscious, automatic, emotional, intuitive thinking.
* “System 2” = The slower, conscious, rational, reasoning, deliberate thinking.

The book is dense and contains a lot of information, this is just my quick notes on what is covered. Probably need to re-read and create better notes.

Expertise, Intuition, Flow, different types of error

Statistics - people's generally poor appreciation

Priming/Anchoring

Availability heuristic

Stereotypes 

Reversion to the mean

Making predictions

Causal Explanations

Randomness

Algorithms

Losses

Experiencing self vs Remembering Self
