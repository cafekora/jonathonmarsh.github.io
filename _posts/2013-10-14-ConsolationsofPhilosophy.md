**Summary**

Funny (and wise) walk through the history of philosphy, showing how their ideas can be helpful to us today.

**My notes**

- Consolation for Unpopularity (Socrates)
- Consolation for Not Having Enough Money (Epicurus)
- Consolation for Frustration (Seneca)
- Consolation for Inadequacy (Montaigne)
- Consolation for a Broken Heart (Schopenhauer)
- Consolation for Difficulties (Nietzsche)
