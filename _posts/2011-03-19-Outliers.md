Why some people are so much more successful - talent, circumstances, oppotunity big factors, but it takes about 10,000 hours of hard work to master something. A write-up of Ericsson’s study basically.
No such thing as “naturals” (in music, at least). Ten years is roughly how long it takes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. Examples include The Beatles, Bill Gates

Also talks about cultural factors - honour/insults,   “individualism-collectivism scale”, “uncertainty avoidance”  i.e. how well does a culture tolerate ambiguity? 
Which national cultures place the highest emphasis on effort and hard work.
