**Summary**

Probably not one I'd recommend. It's fairly detailed, dense and looks at the lives of a set of "masters" (mostly obvious ones like Mozart, Darwin, Einstein, DaVinci etc.) and tries to draw lessons from this. Nothing too surprising in those lessons though.

**My notes**

If you rigidly follow a plan set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position

Advice on learning/practice:

Go in the opposite direction of all of your natural tendencies when it comes to practice. Resist the temptation to be nice to yourself.

Give precedence to the elements you are not good at.

Resist the lure of easing up on your focus. Train yourself to concentrate in practice with double the intensity, as if it were the real thing times two.

Invent exercises that work on your weaknesses.

Give yourself arbitrary deadlines.
