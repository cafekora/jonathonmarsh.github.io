**Summary**

Basically a praise for brilliant individuals instead of workers following a prescribed system. Pretty much the exact opposite to Gerber's The E-Myth.

**My notes**

During times of change, the very last people you need on your team are well-paid bureaucrats.

If you make your business possible to replicate, others will. 

Win by being more ordinary, more standard, and cheaper. Or win by being faster, more remarkable, and more human.

If we can put it in a manual, we can outsource it. If we can outsource it, we can get it cheaper.

We have everything we need, so we’re not buying commodities. We’re not even buying products. We’re buying relationships and stories and magic.
