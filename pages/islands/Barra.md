Barra is a very nice place to visit, with its main town and ferry port, Castlebay having several shops and restaurants. I enjoyed listening to local band the Vatersay Boys performing in the evening and would love to return for the annual Barra-thon race. The Hebridean Way footpath goes the full length of the island, from the causeway to Vatersay north to the ferry terminal at Ardhmor, where the ferry takes you on to Eriskay. Most of the route goes over the island's hills, on fairly boggy terrain (and no marked paths) but there are road sections near the Isle of Barra beach hotel and the ferry terminal.

The Hebridean Way start point has a nice marker sign.

Although it was sunny on Vatersay, there was a lot of cloud and mist about over on Barra.

A nice statue outside the ferry terminal (which has a cafe selling hot drinks, snacks, sandwiches etc. and a waiting room.)
