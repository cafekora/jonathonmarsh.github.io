Harris is, in my opinion, the most attractive of the Outer Hebrides, and a real highlight of the UK. The Hebridean Way path doesn't visit some of the most interesting and beautiful parts of Harris, so I would recommend that anyone doing the route tries to add on a bit of extra time to properly look around Harris.

After leaving the ferry terminal (highly recommend the chip van parked up there), you go down the main road into Leverburgh (which has a shop) before heading off onto a minor road to Finsbay, through some attractive scenery. You then turn left onto a new path to climb over the hill and soon there is no path (or markers) but navigation is relatively easy as you simply go to the top of the hill, from where you can see the coast.

From there, it is a question of making your way down and finding the gap in the fence to get out on to the road. You proceed along the fairly busy road as far as a white house, where you turn right to head sharply back up the hill. At this point, there is little in the way of obvious path or markers for quite a few miles until Seilebost, and navigation is best attempted with the use of a GPX file or map and compass. The route from Seilebost to Tarbert is slightly better, with some visible path and markers, but still difficult to follow in places. No photos from this part of the route, because visibility was poor.

Tarbert has a good range of facilities and the route follows roads and well made paths through the hills, with good conditions underfoot and no difficulties in navigation. Again, fairly miserable weather, but quite enjoyable, with fine views of An Cliseam and Lewis. There are some sections along the busy main road, but there is plenty of space for those on foot.
