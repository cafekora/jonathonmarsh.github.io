The route takes in relatively little of Berneray. After crossing the causeway, you turn right for the ferry terminal, where again there were numerous cyclists and a few cars waiting to be taken on the beautiful journey across the Sound of Harris. Toilets, but no other facilites at the terminal, although you can get drinks onboard the ferry. As I had arrived early, I had a chance to look around nearby parts of the island, and it seems like a place I would like to return to. 

Nice to see a Hebridean Way sign at the ferry terminal.
