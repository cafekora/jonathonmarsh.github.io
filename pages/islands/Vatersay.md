Vatersay is a small island, the southernmost inhabited island of the Outer Hebrides.

The Hebridean Way path starts at the village hall. There are two beaches, on opposite coasts of the island, quite close to the hall. You can also walk or run a beach a little way South of the hall, to start from the actual far end of the island. Unfortunately, the cafe at the hall doesn't open until late morning, which means it probably misses most of the walkers and cyclists.

The Hebridean Way has a nice marker sign.
