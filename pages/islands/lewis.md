The Hebridean Way footpath currently ends at Stornoway, although it is hoped that a future extension will lead to the creation of a path to the Butt of Lewis, at the tip of the island, where the cycle route ends. There are quite a few nice things to see.

The justifiably famous stone circle of Callanish (in fact, one of a number of stone circles). My third visit here, it really is a beautiful spot, in addition to the archaeological interest.
