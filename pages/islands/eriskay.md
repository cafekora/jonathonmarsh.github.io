Eriskay is a fairly small island and the route goes from the ferry terminal to the causeway across to South Uist, mainly along the beach. Eriskay has a pub, named for the AM Politician, the ship which led to the Compton Mckenzie book Whisky Galore which has been made into films twice. I also took a short detour to the very well-stocked shop.

The ferry from Barra. No need to book ahead for foot passengers. On the day I traveled, there had been quite a lot of disruption and locals were being advised that if they travelled, they might not be able to return home. Fortunately, this ferry ran to time and the wind was not bad. Mostly cyclists on board, and I did see one of them blown over by the wind not long after disembarking.

An amusing alteration to the road sign at the causeway over to South Uist.
