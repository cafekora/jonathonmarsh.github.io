South Uist is the second largest of the Outer Hebrides, but has a population below 2000 people. Not surprising then, that I didn't see anybody at all while running along the coast from the Kildare cafe up to my overnight stay at the Gatliff hostel, a beautiful traditional blackhouse and the nicest place I stayed during the run. Some of the Hebridean islands are quite flat, but the peaks of Beinn Mh√≤r and Hecla, both over 600 metres, were prominent for much of the time.

After going up the west coast of the island, the route turns inland, and takes a number of lengthy detours to avoid sections of the A865. These include a section through the Loch Druidibeag national nature reserve, a mix of new paths and bridges and picking a way across boggy heather moorland. After passing the Our Lady of the Isles statue, there is a very boggy stretch around the outflows of Loch Bee. The route then picks up the A865 and the causeway to Benbecula. After a day without any facilities in terms of food etc. (or indeed a mobile phone signal), there is a supermarket (Lovats) at the south end of the causeway and a Co-Op at the north end.

South Uist beach. No machair in flower in September, but beautiful nonetheless.

Plenty of archaeology to be seen today, this is the not-quite-so old Caisteal Bheagram, a medieval tower sitting on a small island in the loch.

One of many nice bridges, and a fairly obvious path for once.
