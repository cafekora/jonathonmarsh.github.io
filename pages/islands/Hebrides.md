In September 2019, I ran the 156 mile Hebridean Way Footpath, taking a week to complete it. The path starts on Vatersay in the South and finishes at Stornoway in Lewis, visiting 10 islands of the Outer Hebrides. This requires two lovely ferry trips between islands, but also uses the six causeways which have been built connecting the islands together
The route includes some beautiful beaches, amazing loch, sea and mountain views and some very interesting archaeology and Gaelic culture. The terrain is not too hilly, but navigation and weather can be challenging, and conditions underfoot boggy (at best). The route is mostly off-road and there are long sections with no phone coverage or access to facilities like shops.
